-- test_app.py is the main .py file. The other .py files contain functions in them that are called
-- in the main .py file

-- The app also requires the OPENAI_API_KEY. Therefore, use your own apikey. If you don't
-- have one, go to 
-- https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview
-- and purchase your apikey




1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`: Run this command to install the prerequisites for this application

2. Set the apikey as an environment variable using the command
   ` os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key" ` 
   Add the command to the main .py file

3. If you want to run the app locally, use the command `streamlit run test_app.py`

4. If you want to deploy the app on streamlit, firstly erase the command that sets the apikey as environment variable from the code

5. Streamlit doesn't allow us to use apikeys during deployment to avoid security breaches. As a result, replace the said command with
   ` os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] == st.secrets["api_key"] `

6. Store all the .py and .png files in a public github repository

7. Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud

8. Click on `Get Started` and subsequently on `New App`

9. Fill the fields correctly. Under `main file path`, mention the main .py file. In our case, it was test_app.py

10. Click on advanced settings

11. In the blank area provided, initialise a secret variable

12. For instance, type    ` api_key = "your_api_key" `

13. Note how the key name in the st.secrets dictionary and the variable name here correspond

14. Deploy the app
